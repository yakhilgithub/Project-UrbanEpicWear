# UrbanEpicWear: ThatWasEpic Website Clone
# Day28 of 30 days 30 projects challenge


## Overview:
UrbanEpicWear is my latest project where I've recreated the cool ThatWasEpic clothing website. It's all about learning web development and trying my hand at creating a snazzy online store.
Just to be clear, this is all about the front-end—no actual buying or selling happens here.


## Purpose:
I built this to get hands-on with HTML and CSS, no fancy backend stuff. UrbanEpicWear is like a practice run to understand how real e-commerce websites are structured and styled.


## Features:
Responsive Design: UrbanEpicWear looks good on your phone, tablet, or computer—try it out!
Product Sections: Check out the official tees, featured collections, and some original designs just like on ThatWasEpic.
Join the Movement: There's a spot to subscribe for updates, kind of like signing up for a newsletter.


## Explanation:
I used HTML and CSS to make this happen. The HTML file (TWE.html) sets up the webpage structure, while the TWE.css file adds the cool colors and styles.


Feel free to explore the code and drop me a line with your thoughts! If you have any questions or cool ideas, don't hesitate to reach out.
